This is a small microblog, which I intend to use a personal page later.
Currently the state of this is just my playground to muck about with flask and 
jinja2. It is now quite loosely based on the flask tutorial found on 
http://flask.pocoo.org. I've modified things a bit and added bootstrap in order
to make it prettier. 
So far I can say that flask is awesome!

Just chuck in your own config.py of the form:

class Config(object):
    DATABASE = '/my/db/is/here'
    DEBUG = True#don't leave it on on prod systems.
    SECRET_KEY = 'some_key_goes_here'
    USERNAME = 'Who_are_you?'
    PASSWORD = 'yourPassWordHere!'

Also, run it this way:

> python run.py
